## ü™ú Steps I took to optimize the page load time

- Used CDN instead npm module for icons to minmize loading time.
- Used SVG icons wherever possible as they are lighter than image type icons.
- Used Lighthouse DevTools Extension to find the performance issues and fix them using their actionable suggestion.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
